//6.We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a square and a circle. Create an abstract class 'Shape' with three abstract methods namely 'RectangleArea' taking two parameters, 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' taking one parameter each. The parameters of 'RectangleArea' are its length and breadth, that of 'SquareArea' is its side and that of 'CircleArea' is its radius. Now create another class 'Area' containing all the three methods 'RectangleArea', 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' for printing the area of rectangle, square and circle respectively. Create an object of class 'Area' and call all the three methods.
package capgeminiPractice;
abstract class Shape{
	public abstract int rectangleArea(int length,int breadth);
	public abstract int squareArea(int side);
	public abstract double circleArea(int radius);
}
class Areas extends Shape{

	@Override
	public int rectangleArea(int length, int breadth) {
		return length*breadth;
		
	}

	@Override
	public int squareArea(int side) {
		return side*side;
		
	}

	@Override
	public double circleArea(int radius) {
		return 3.14*radius*radius;
	}
	
}

public class Area {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Areas area=new Areas();
		System.out.println("Rectangle area: "+area.rectangleArea(7, 8));
		System.out.println("Square area: "+area.squareArea(8));
		System.out.println("Rectangle area: "+area.circleArea(4));
	}

}
